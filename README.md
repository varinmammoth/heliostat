Ray tracing software and analysis for Physics BSc Project. 

The main files are:
playground_fast.py          |       This file contains the main ray tracing simulation, written to be compatable with Numba.

initialization_code_fast.py |       This file contains the code to initialise rays, mirror configurations, mirror orientations, etc., written to be compatable with Numba.

playground.py and initialization_code.py are the original versions of the above two files. The other files are tests, simulations, analysis, and miscellaneous things.
